# ðŸŽ“ Student Management API

A **.NET 7 Web API** project designed for managing students, with a strong focus on **modern authentication/authorization** and **clean architecture principles**.  
This project is built as a learning-oriented template to understand how **JWT Authentication**, **ASP.NET Core Identity**, and **design patterns** like **Repository** and **Unit of Work (UoW)** come together in a scalable application.

---

## ðŸš€ Features

- **JWT Authentication**
  - Secure login using JSON Web Tokens.
  - Bearer token support for stateless authentication.
  - Configurable expiration and refresh handling.

- **Role-based Authorization**
  - Role claims embedded in JWT.
  - Fine-grained access to endpoints (`Admin`, `Teacher`, `Student`).

- **ASP.NET Core Identity**
  - Manages users, roles, password hashing, claims.
  - Integrates seamlessly with EF Core.

- **Repository & Unit of Work Pattern**
  - Clean abstraction over EF Core.
  - Testable, maintainable, and scalable data access.
  - Transactional consistency ensured with Unit of Work.

- **Clean Architecture**
  - Separation of concerns across layers:
    - **Domain** â†’ Entities, core logic.
    - **Application** â†’ Services, interfaces, DTOs.
    - **Infrastructure** â†’ EF Core, repositories, identity.
    - **Presentation** â†’ API controllers.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure (Clean Arch)

src/
â”œâ”€â”€ StudentManager.Domain # Core business entities & logic
â”œâ”€â”€ StudentManager.Application # Interfaces, DTOs, business services
â”œâ”€â”€ StudentManager.Infrastructure # Data, Identity, Repositories, UoW
â””â”€â”€ StudentManager.API # Web API layer (controllers, middleware)

## ðŸ”‘ Authentication Flow (JWT + Identity)

1. **User Registration** â†’ User is created in the Identity store with hashed password.
2. **User Login** â†’ Identity verifies credentials â†’ issues JWT with claims (roles, user id, etc.).
3. **Bearer Token** â†’ JWT is passed in the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header.
4. **Authorization** â†’ Middleware validates token, reads roles/claims, grants/denies access.
